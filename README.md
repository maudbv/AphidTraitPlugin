# AphidTraitPlugin
by Maud Bernard-Verdier, March 2021

**ImageJ Plugin** in Jython for streamlined measurements of aphid traits on microscopic photography.
 
The plugin creates a small user interface to select images, measure length of body parts, store results and open next image efficiently.
It is not quite generic at this stage, and designed for use in my lab.
